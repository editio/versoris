               <note>Crux’s studies at King Wenceslas College at Prague University between April and November 1459 are well documented by the large number of colophons he left. He did not obtain any degree, which is not surprising, given that he was Catholic and the situation at Prague University in the 1450s did not favor Catholics. He subsequently worked for the Catholic Church administration, first at St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague (1463–1466), and later in Plzeň (1468–1472). He was ordained in 1463 and joined the Augustinian canonry in Třeboň (Wittingau in German).</note> <!-- no links inside biography -->
